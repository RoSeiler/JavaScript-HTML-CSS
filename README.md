# JavaScript-HTML-CSS

Calculator:
First, I created the structure and appearance for the HTML and CSS of the calculator on iOS devices. Then, I created the underlying functionality for the JavaScript of the calculator on iOS devices and I practiced breaking a problem down into simple, achievable steps, and ended up with a working calculator that performs basic math operations.

Working with dogs:
Here I incorporated JavaScript into my websites creating two projects: an image carousel that uses JavaScript code, and then an application that retrieves data about dog breeds from an API (that's 'dog-project'). The other folder, 'Olivia', is about my dog =)
